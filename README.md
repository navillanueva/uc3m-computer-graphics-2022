# Computer Graphics Final Project 

Foggy night street scenario image generated programming with povray as the final project for my computer graphics course at universidad carlos 3 de madrid in may of 2022.

In case you want to run the code from your computer, in the file practicaFinal.pov you will have to update the import paths. I organized the code a bit before uploading it to github, originally all of the files were in the same folder.

Here you can see the final result:
